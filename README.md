# DSA
My Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey – includes problems, solutions, explanations, and implementations in C++/Java/Python (depending on your choice). Updated regularly.


# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Learning Journey  

This repository contains my personal notes, problem solutions, and implementations while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It serves as both a **learning log** and a **reference** for anyone interested in practicing DSA.  

---

## 📌 What’s Inside
- ✅ Classic Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing)  
- ✅ Fundamental Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Greedy, DP)  
- ✅ Problem Solutions from platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, BeeCrowd, HackerRank, etc.)  
- ✅ Well-commented code with explanations  

---

---

## 📌 Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of **core DSA concepts**.
- Practice **problem-solving** through coding exercises.
- Build a strong foundation for **competitive programming** and **technical interviews**.
- Regularly update with new problems and solutions.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DSA-Learnings.git
2. Navigate to a folder and compile any file:

g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1
./problem1

📅 Progress & Updates

- I will be pushing solutions daily/weekly as I continue my DSA practice.

- This repo will grow with time and cover most standard DSA topics, as I learn new concepts and solve problems.

👉 This way, your repo looks like both a **portfolio** and a **study log**.  

Do you want me to also create a **DSA Topic Checklist** (like Arrays ✅, Linked List ⬜, Trees ⬜, Graphs ⬜, DP ⬜), so you can track your learning progress directly in your README?
